This is a small set of python apps that I built 10 years ago in order to add, modify, and delete email address entries held in an LDAP
attached to a postfix mail server.

I built the mail server for a church and needed to admin a large 
contact email database in order to notify members/elders/staff of 
goings on in the church.

These originally ran under CGI, but could also operate in other ways.

As I understand it, these are also useable for Active Directory lookups 
as well, but I never tested that idea.

There is NO warrantibility for use, nore do I remember the sources I used to 
create them.
